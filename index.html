		<p>My name is Kaila Grant and I am from tropical island Jamaica! I attended two high schools, the first being Mount Alvernia High School (an all-girl Catholic school) and the other is called Herbert Morrison Technical High School (a co-ed school).Most of my current friends are from my first high school. I have three siblings and three pets: one cat, two dogs. My hobbies include reading, listening to music, drawing, watching anime, learning coding languages, and watching horror game theories.</P>
